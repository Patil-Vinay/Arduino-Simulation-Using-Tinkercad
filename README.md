# Arduino-Simulation-Using-Tinkercad-
I started learning how to use Arduino online using Autodesk Tinkercad. I thank them for helping me gain intrest in Arduino projects. After i did some tinkering i bought a physical Arduino and it was fun. I have added solutions for some interesting problem statements.
